## Abstract

The term Spectral Clustering is a collection of algorithms. 
Many researchers propose their own variations and 
algorithm specific justifications. We observe that 
the core operation of Spectral Clustering is eigen value 
decomposition and an embedding step is implicitly or 
explicitly performed. This is analogous to Spectral Embedding
algorithms and many eigen decomposition based Dimensionality 
Reduction methods from machine learning community. In 
this article, we term them all as Spectral Embedding 
Technique. 

In this survey, we first construct a simple-minded 
sample spectral clustering algorithm. 
Then we conclude taxonomy of spectral clustering.
Next, we propose 
a general three-stage framework of spectral clustering.  
Combinatoric, stochastic, and other type of justifications
are collected and organized in later sections. 
After that, we give a brief introduction on 
several representative dimensionality 
reduction methods and relate them to our general 
spectral clustering framework. 
We give several unifying views of Spectral Embedding 
Technique: graph framework, kernel framework, 
trace maximization. We end this article with 
a discussion on the relationship between 
Kernel K-Means and Spectral Clustering. 

This article aims at providing systematic ways 
to explore new spectral clustering algorithms.
At the same time, we hope to gain some insights 
through the analysis of a bunch of algorithms.  
Source code of documents and sample algorithms can be found 
in the online open source repository.
