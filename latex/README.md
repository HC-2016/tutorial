# LaTeX

The best time to write a tutorial for something is when you learn it. 
You are fresh with it so you know what problems other novice users have.
This dir is out of maintanence, because:

   * I didn't find time to write a LaTeX tutorial one year ago. 
   Now I already lose a fresh mind that is essential for writing tutorials. 
   * For useful LaTeX tricks, you can refer to my notes under my website:
   <http://hupili.github.io/articles/latex.html>
   * I'm using **TeXmacs** now. 
   It is powerful and boosts my efficiency in academic writing by more than 3 times!
   My daily work is done using TeXmacs. 
   LaTeX is only used for formal publication. 
   Check it out. 
   You will never regret!
