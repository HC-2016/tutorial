%>============================================
\begin{abstract}
	Matrix Calculus\cite{wiki_mc} is a very useful tool in many 
	engineering problems. Basic rules of matrix calculus are 
	nothing more than ordinary calculus rules covered in 
	undergraduate courses. However, using matrix calculus, 
	the derivation process is more compact. This document is 
	adapted from the notes of a course the author recently attends.
	It builds matrix calculus from scratch. Only prerequisites 
	are basic calculus notions and linear algebra operation.  
	To get a quick executive guide, please refer to the cheat 
	sheet in the end.

\section{Introductory Example}

We start with an one variable linear function:
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = ax
\end{equation}

To be coherent, we abuse the partial derivative notation:
\begin{equation}
	\pdiff{f}{x} = a
	\label{eq:fax-single}
\end{equation}

Extending this function to be multivariate, we have:
\begin{equation}
	f(x) = \sum_{i}{a_ix_i} = \tran{a}x
\end{equation}
%The followings are the suggested transpose online? 
%What do you prefer? 
%I choose \mathrm at present. It looks reasonably good. 
%	a^\intercal
%	a^\mathsf{T}
%	a^\mathrm{T}
%	a^\top
%	a^\bot
Where $a = \tran{[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n]}$ and 
$x = \tran{[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]}$. 
We first compute partial derivatives directly:
\begin{equation}
	\pdiff{f}{x_k} = \pdiff{(\sum_{i}{a_ix_i})}{x_k} = a_k 
\end{equation}
for all $k=1,2, \ldots, n$. Then we organize $n$ partial derivatives
in the following way:
\begin{equation}
	\pdiff{f}{x} = \left[
	\begin{matrix}
		\pdiff{f}{x_1} \\
		\pdiff{f}{x_2} \\
		\vdots \\
		\pdiff{f}{x_n}
	\end{matrix}
	\right]
	= \left[
	\begin{matrix}
		a_1 \\
		a_2 \\
		\vdots \\
		a_n
	\end{matrix}
	\right]
	= a
	\label{eq:fax-multi}
\end{equation}
The first equality is by proper definition and the rest roots from 
ordinary calculus rules. 

Eqn(\ref{eq:fax-multi}) is analogous to eqn(\ref{eq:fax-single}), except
the variable changes from a scalar to a vector. Thus we want to directly 
claim the result of eqn(\ref{eq:fax-multi}) without those intermediate steps 
solving for partial derivatives separately. Actually, we'll see soon 
that eqn(\ref{eq:fax-multi}) plays a core role in matrix calculus. 

Following sections are organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Section(\ref{sec:derivation}) builds commonly used 
	matrix calculus rules from ordinary calculus and linear 
	algebra. Necessary and important properties of linear 
	algebra is also proved along the way. 
	\item Section(\ref{sec:application}) shows some applications 
	using matrix calculus. 
	\item Section(\ref{sec:cheat}) concludes a cheat sheet of 
	matrix calculus. Note that this cheat sheet may be different 
	from others. Users need to figure out some basic definitions 
	before applying the rules. 
\end{itemize}
